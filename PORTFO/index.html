                <h3>About me</h3>
                
                <p id="pp1">"I'm Alia Bhatt, a Bollywood actress born and raised in the heart of Mumbai.Acting isn't just a career for me; it's a passion that runs deep in my veins. You might remember me from films like 'Student of the Year' and 'Raazi,' where I've had the privilege to bring diverse characters to life on the silver screen.
        

                    But beyond the glitz and glamour of the industry, I'm just a girl with dreams, navigating my way through life's adventures. Whether it's immersing myself in a challenging role or advocating for causes close to my heart, I strive to make a meaningful impact wherever I go.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    And hey, fashion isn't just a hobby; it's an expression of my personality. From red carpet glam to casual chic, I love experimenting with different styles and trends.<br>
                    <br>
                    
                    But perhaps what truly drives me is the opportunity to inspire others, especially the youth of our nation. Through my work and actions, I hope to encourage others to chase their dreams fearlessly and make a positive difference in the world.
                    
                    So, here's to embracing every moment, chasing every dream, and living life unapologetically. Because for me, the journey is just as important as the destination."
